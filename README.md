# StayFree Destop - MacOS, Windows, and Linux

This repo holds the release packages for the MacOS, Windows, and Linux versions of StayFree.

These desktop platforms are under heavy development right now and contain a minimal feature set. They will be expanded with the full suite of StayFree features (that our users love!) as we continue to develop them.

For the initial release:
* These apps are just tracking application usage on your computer.
  * So if you used "Google Chrome" for 2 hours and "Visual Studio Code" for another hour, that is what would show up within the app.
  * At this time, they do not track website usage within your browser.
  * Please rely on our browser extensions to track website usage within your browsers: https://stayfreeapps.com
 
Notable features that are missing:
* App blocking functionality has not been implemented yet. This will come in the next release.
* The desktop app doesn't yet connect to our cross platform system (so it won't display usage from your phone/browser extension). This will be added in the near future.
* App icons do not exist yet. These will be implemented as we get a clearer picture around the usage of this version of StayFree.
* Advanced blocking features like Focus Mode will be implemented in the uncoming releases.
* UI functionality for more in-depth stats, comparisons, and usability will also be prioritized for the upcoming releases.
* Over time, the functionality of this app will closely resemble that of our browser extensions.

## Installing the App

* MacOS: TODO
* Windows: TODO
* Linux: TODO
